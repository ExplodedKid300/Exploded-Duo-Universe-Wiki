        <section id="appearance">
            <h2>Appearance</h2>
            <p>Ellyn stands out with her bright golden-yellow hair, which she keeps long and flowing, and her striking green eyes that seem to sparkle with excitement. Her attire is as vibrant as her personality: she wears a shirt that's light blue on one half and dark blue on the other, symbolizing her balance of energetic enthusiasm and grounded wisdom. She pairs her shirt with jean shorts, practical and comfortable for any adventure, and sturdy boots that are well-worn from her many travels. Ellyn has a carefree yet confident demeanor, with an ever-present smile that reflects her optimistic outlook on life.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="personality">
            <h2>Personality</h2>
            <p>Ellyn is the embodiment of cheerfulness and energy. She’s always ready for a new adventure, often the first to jump into action at the mere suggestion of one. Her infectious optimism makes her an excellent companion, brightening up any room she walks into. However, despite her bubbly and playful nature, Ellyn is no stranger to serious moments. She has a strong sense of duty, especially when it comes to helping her friends. This was most evident when she assisted Abeth and Alianna in fulfilling the prophecy to protect Ironell, showing that, when the time comes, Ellyn can be deeply focused and determined.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="biography">
            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>Ellyn is impossibly lucky—there’s no other way to explain it. Whether it’s winning at games of chance, making the right decisions at the right time, or narrowly avoiding danger, Ellyn’s luck always seems to be on her side. She could easily empty a slot machine's tokens just because she’d win the jackpot almost 99% of the time, and everyone around her is continually amazed by her strange ability to bend fate in her favor.</p>
            <p>Originally from [Insert previous state lived in], Ellyn moved to Brightveil seeking a change of scenery and new opportunities. It was there that she met the Ames sisters, Abeth and Alianna, and the three of them became fast friends, their bond quickly becoming unbreakable. Ellyn is a powerful mage, but unlike Abeth and Alianna, she isn’t limited to the four traditional elements. Her magical talents are vast and versatile, allowing her to cast almost any spell, from conjuring creatures to controlling time and space.</p>
            <p>Despite her energetic and carefree personality, Ellyn can switch into a more serious mindset when the stakes are high. This was demonstrated when she joined Abeth and Alianna to protect Ironell from a dark fate. Her determination, when focused, is a key asset to the trio’s success in fulfilling the prophecy.</p>

        <section id="abilities">
            <h2>Abilities</h2>
            <p>Ellyn’s magic is incredibly diverse. She’s not restricted to the traditional elements like the Ames sisters, and her powers span across all magical disciplines. Whether it’s the destructive forces of Evocation, the practical applications of Conjuration, or the delicate manipulations of Illusion, Ellyn can perform nearly any spell she desires. Some of her more notable abilities include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Evocation:</strong> Ellyn can summon elemental forces—fire, wind, earth, water, and even more exotic elements—to cause explosive damage or protect her allies. Her evocation magic is especially potent in combat situations.</li>
                <li><strong>Conjuration:</strong> Ellyn can create objects, creatures, and even entire environments out of thin air. This ability is useful for both practical and combat purposes, such as summoning weapons or conjuring helpful allies.</li>
                <li><strong>Illusion:</strong> Ellyn can manipulate light and sound to create lifelike illusions, confusing enemies or hiding herself and her friends when necessary.</li>
                <li><strong>Transmutation:</strong> Ellyn is capable of turning one substance into another, often using this ability to solve problems or aid her allies in unexpected ways.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>One area of magic Ellyn refuses to dabble in, however, is Necromancy. She despises this dark branch of magic, believing that disturbing the dead or controlling the souls of others goes against the natural order of life.</p>

                <li>She has an extensive collection of magical artifacts from her adventures, each one with a story that Ellyn loves to tell.</li>
