        <section id="biography">
            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>Alianna's early years were marked by sadness and uncertainty. When she was just five years old, her parents abandoned her for reasons she never fully understood. Left to fend for herself, she wandered aimlessly until she was discovered by Abeth, who saw her plight and took her in. From that moment, Alianna's life changed, and she found not only a home but a family with Abeth, who became the sister she never had.</p>
            <p>As Alianna grew older, she discovered an unexpected talent for magic. While she wasn't born with innate magical abilities like some, she found that with effort and dedication, she could learn and master elemental spells. Her ability to wield magic came with challenges, as it didn't come naturally to her, but she embraced it as an opportunity to grow stronger and prove herself. She also trained in various weapons, ensuring she was prepared for any danger that might arise.</p>
            <p>Alianna's life took a dramatic turn when she learned of an ancient prophecy that foretold her as the savior of Ironell, destined to shield the land from a dark and looming fate. Alongside her sister Abeth and their trusted ally Ellyn, Alianna embarked on a perilous journey to confront the Shadows of Fate, a malevolent force threatening to plunge Ironell into despair. Through courage, ingenuity, and the strength of her bonds with her companions, Alianna rose to the challenge, ultimately fulfilling the prophecy and saving Ironell from destruction.</p>
            <p>Emerging from the adventure forever changed, Alianna now carries the legacy of a hero. Though she humbly views herself as someone who simply did what was necessary, the people of Ironell regard her as a symbol of hope and resilience. Despite her newfound fame, she remains the same cheerful, curious girl at heart, eager to continue learning, growing, and exploring the world she fought so hard to protect.</p>

            <p><strong>Electric Magic:</strong> She's fascinated by electricity and enjoys experimenting with lightning-based attacks, though she occasionally overcharges her spells, leading to unintended shocks.</p>
