        <section id="personality">
            <h2>Personality</h2>
            <p>Abeth is the epitome of a caring and protective older sister. While she's fiercely loyal and supportive of her loved ones, she can be a bit overprotective, especially toward <a href="alianna.html">Alianna</a>, whom she adopted after the young girl was abandoned. She has a strong sense of justice and is unafraid to step into action when she believes someone is in danger. Her calm and composed nature hides a deep well of courage and resourcefulness, which has been essential in both her quest to find her parents and in the battle to save Ironell.</p>

        <section id="biography">
            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>Abeth's life changed drastically when she was just 10 years old, and her parents mysteriously vanished without a trace. The loss of her parents set her on a journey to uncover the truth behind their disappearance. During this time, she discovered a young girl, <a href="alianna.html">Alianna</a>, abandoned and alone, and without hesitation, took her in, adopting her as her sister. The two became inseparable, and their bond only grew stronger as they faced challenges together.</p>
            <p>Abeth played a pivotal role in uncovering an ancient prophecy hidden in a cave near Brightveil Village, which foretold of a hero who would protect Ironell from a dark fate. Along with their friend <a href="ellyn.html">Ellyn</a>, Abeth and <a href="alianna.html">Alianna</a> worked together to fulfill the prophecy, ensuring Ironell's future and saving the land from an impending disaster. This achievement cemented Abeth's role as a protector of Ironell, and she continues to guide <a href="alianna.html">Alianna</a> in honing her magical skills.</p>

        <section id="abilities">
            <h2>Abilities</h2>
            <p>Abeth was born with the Magic of the Four Elements—Light, Fire, Ice, and Electric—and has mastered all four by the age of 17. Her control over these elements is exceptional, and she uses them with precision in both combat and support roles. Here's a breakdown of her abilities:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Light Magic:</strong> Abeth can manipulate light to create blinding flashes or protective barriers. She also uses it for healing purposes, channeling the light to accelerate the body's natural healing process.</li>
                <li><strong>Fire Magic:</strong> Abeth can summon and control fire, using it for offensive attacks such as fireballs, flames, or creating barriers of flame. Her fire magic is particularly powerful in combat, and she can also use it to cook or provide warmth in survival situations.</li>
                <li><strong>Ice Magic:</strong> Abeth uses ice to freeze her enemies or to create barriers of ice. She can also form sharp ice projectiles that are useful in both defense and attack. Her ice magic is often used to trap enemies or manipulate the environment in her favor.</li>
                <li><strong>Electric Magic:</strong> Abeth can harness the power of electricity, using it to shock her enemies, power machinery, or create electric shields. Her electric magic is quick and effective, often giving her the edge in battle.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Currently, Abeth is mentoring <a href="alianna.html">Alianna</a> to help her learn to control the Four Elements, just as she did when she was younger. Though <a href="alianna.html">Alianna</a>'s magical abilities are still developing, Abeth is patient and diligent in her teachings.</p>
